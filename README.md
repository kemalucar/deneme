Simple low poly Multiple Character clone with , Multiple Animations from 3dprof.com  

for Babylonjs

Live : http://3dprof.com/test/

low poly Male and Female character with 4 clones , 4 different animations same time.

( characters exported from 3dsmax to .baylon file )

-not need animation groups,
-not need animation range,
-just sequential animations by keyframe.

Mesh files must be .baylon format, cause .glb file format and webgl2 cant clone skeletons yet :)

Thanks
