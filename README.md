Simple low poly Multiple Character cloning with , Multiple Animations  

for Babylon.js

Live : http://3dprof.com/test/

Babylon.js playground : https://playground.babylonjs.com/#STWVDD

low poly Male and Female character with 4 clones , 4 different animations same time.

( characters can export from 3dsmax or blender etc. to .baylon file )

-not need animation groups,
-not need animation range,
-just sequential animations by keyframe.

Mesh files must be .baylon format, cause .glb file format and webgl2 cant clone skeletons yet :)

Thanks
